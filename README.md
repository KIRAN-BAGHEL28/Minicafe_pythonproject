Minicafe Ordering System
This project is a simple text-based food ordering system for a fictional cafe called Minicafe. It allows customers to browse a menu, select food items, and calculate the total cost of their order.

Features:
Dynamic Menu Display: The menu items and their prices are stored in a dictionary and displayed at the start.
Order Processing: Users can repeatedly add items to their order by inputting the name of the item.
Order Validation: If the user inputs an item that is not available in the menu, an error message is shown.
Loop for Multiple Items: The program runs in a loop, allowing users to add as many items as they wish until they decide to stop.
Total Cost Calculation: The system keeps track of the total cost of the items ordered and displays the total amount to be paid at the end.
Key Concepts:
Python Data Structures: Utilizes a dictionary to store menu items and their corresponding prices.
Input Handling: Takes user input to determine which items are being ordered.
Loops: A while loop is used to repeatedly ask the user for items until they choose to stop.
Conditional Statements: Used for checking whether the item is in the menu and whether the user wants to continue adding more items.
How to Run:
Run the Python script.
The menu will be displayed, and the user will be prompted to input an order.
The user can continue adding items or stop by responding to prompts.
At the end, the total cost of the items is calculated and displayed.
This is a basic project aimed at beginners to help them practice Python programming with a simple real-world use case. It demonstrates the use of loops, conditionals, input validation, and dictionaries.
